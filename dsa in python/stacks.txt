--push is a function that is used to insesrt values into the stack 
  if we tried to push elements even after the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs 
   we can check the weather the stack is full or nut by using isFull() function
--pop is a function is used to remove the element that is present in the top of the stack 
  if we tried to pop elements even after the stack is empty then the underflow condition occurs 
  we can check the weather the stack is empty or not using isEmpty() function
--peek() -- funciotn is used to return the value that is present in the top of the function it doesn't remvoe any value like pop does
  when we said the peek value then we need to write the value of the top element 
  but when we say top then we need to write the index of the stack
--when the stack is empty and when we call top the value is -1 it's not 0 as the first element in the stack begins with 0
