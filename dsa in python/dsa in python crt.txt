linear data structures   --    stacks,queues,linked lists                            data where the data elents ae arranged sequentially or linearlly where the elements are attached to its       previous and next adjacent in what is called in a linear data structure
non linear data structures --  graphs,trees


stacks--empty() returns weather the stack is empty or not  o(1)
size() return the size of the stack means the size that is fixed for stack
getsize() returns the no of available elements that are present in the stack
peek() only returns the element that is present in the top of stack


queues
fifo
enque  --inserting elements in the queue
dequeue  removing elements from the queue
full -- return true if there are maxsize items in the queue
get --element is used to remove an item from the queue if queue is empty wait until an item is availble if the queue is empty then it enters into the infinie loop



linked-lists
---------------------------------
they don't store elements at random locations but we can able to access them sequential manner
every element contains two parts --data part,and next part -contains the reference to the next element
if the next part is last node then it contains the null value
head node is the first node in the linked lists

efficiency of linked lists vs list
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
linked list is more efficient than list while inseting or deleting the elements in between 
while deleting the element from the last then the time complexity is same

retrival element then list is more efficient than linked lists
most of the cases linked list is more efficicent

Non linear data structures 
graphs 
trees

graph is a non linear data structure having set of vertices and edges they are multiple types those are 
directed graph and 
undirected graph
weighted graph
unweighted graph
google maps are an example for weighted undirected graphs
--------------------------------------------------------------------
trees are used while representing the family
the representation of trees is in hireachal manner
the nodes that are present in the down of the tree is leaf node
the head node is root node
